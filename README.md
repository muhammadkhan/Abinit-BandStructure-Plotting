# Abinit-BandStructure-Plotting
A supplementary tool for the ABINIT (http://www.abinit.org) computational quantum mechanics package. Able to plot crystal k-space (reciprocal momentum space) energy eigenvalues to visualize the material's band theory (band gaps, etc). Current functionality includes:
 - Exporting to CSV
 - Translation of values such that Fermi level is set to 0
 - Uses JFreeChart (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart) to plot data and save plot as image (automatically)
